      <div class="hobbie-txt"><p>Emersyn's hobbies are everywhere as she figures herself in these young years. She loves watching Snake Discovery videos, and we visited their zoo. She also loves animals and anything biology. We go to the Omaha Zoo as much as possible, knowing it like the back of our hands. She also loves to go to different children's museums to learn, play, and discover. She loves to ask questions, create art, and learn about the natural world. She has been starting to get into more video games, too, playing Slime Rancher, Untitled Goose Game, and a little bit of Overwatch. I make sure that she doesn't talk in the public chat for her safety; people are very mean to new players in that game, so I ensure that she ignores all the mean people and continues to have fun. I guarantee this rule applies to any online game she plays for her safety.</p></div>
