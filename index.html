            <div class="column"><p>Emersyn is a very bright little girl. She has always had an excellent vocabulary for her age and continues to ask questions. I am biased as she is my sister, but she is a strong, independent (and very spoiled) person. She will hold her ground and fight back if she doesn't think something is right. She will use her remarkable ability to learn to understand others and the struggles that they may be going through, as well as her other great ability to argue and stand up for people and herself.</p></div>

          <div class="row2">
            <div class="column"><p>Emersyn is a part of two different clubs at her school. She plays a leading role in the JAG program, where she learns more about the world and pushes herself to understand the world better than she grew up in. She is also a part of the GSA club, where she loves interacting, supporting, and teaching other kids in the LGBTQ+ community. She loves to make buttons and give them to her classmates for support. As she is still in middle school, she is still working on awards and other such things, but I know with time, she will continue to thrive in the environment that she pushes herself toward.</p></div>
